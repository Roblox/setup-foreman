# Setup Foreman GitHub Action
GitHub Action to install [Foreman](https://github.com/Roblox/foreman), a toolchain manager primarily intended for Roblox projects.

This action will install a release version of Foreman and run `foreman install` from the root of your project. This ensures any tools specified in your project's `foreman.toml` file will be available to the rest of the workflow!

## Usage
Add a step to your workflow file:

```yaml
- uses: Roblox/setup-foreman@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Action Parameters

#### `token` (required)
A GitHub token used to interact with the GitHub API. This is used for installing Foreman itself, and then passed to Foreman to install other tools from GitHub.

#### `version` (optional)
A SemVer version range of Foreman to install.

If not specified, the latest stable release will be installed.

#### `working-directory` (optional)
A working directory in which `foreman install` will be executed.

If not specified the root job folder will be used.

#### `allow-external-github-orgs` (optional)
A boolean value to allow external github orgs in the foreman manifest file.

If not specified, external github orgs will not be allowed.

#### `github-api-url` (optional)
Override for the GitHub API URL. By default GitHub Actions will supply this
value as the current environment, which will usually be
`https://api.github.com`.

This parameter exists primarily to allow GitHub Enterprise to point back to
GitHub Cloud to install publicly hosted tools.

As such, for any use of this action in GitHub Enterprise, `github-api-url`
should be included like so:
```yaml
- uses: Roblox/setup-foreman@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    github-api-url: "https://api.github.com"
```
